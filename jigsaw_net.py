"""JigsawNet: a self-supervised neural encoder trained ONLY with cross-entropy.

No contrastive learning. No InfoNCE. No positive/negative pairs. No temperature.
No dependency on, and no objective borrowed from, time-contrastive embedding
methods. Every loss in this file is torch cross_entropy or
binary_cross_entropy_with_logits on a task with a hard, known-correct label.

    from jigsaw_net import JigsawNet
    model = JigsawNet(window_size=10, n_tiles=4, max_epochs=60)
    model.fit(X_train, X_valid=X_valid)
    Z = model.transform(X_valid)                    # decode THIS
    print(model.evaluate_pretext(X_valid))
    print(model.evaluate_decoding(X_train, Y_train, X_valid, Y_valid))

THE THREE TASKS (all cross-entropy)
-----------------------------------
1. ORDER (the jigsaw). K intact, chronological, nonoverlapping tiles are cut
   from one span. Two readouts share a permutation-equivariant DeepSets token:
     - position CE : K-way softmax per tile, "which slot in time is this?".
       Chance 1/K. Scales to any K, unlike a K!-way label which explodes and is
       memorizable (24 classes is a lookup table; 4 classes x 4 tiles is not).
     - pair BCE    : for every ordered pair, "did i come before j?". Chance 50%,
       which is a far higher-powered test than 1/24 = 4.17%.
   The position head is DECODED WITH AN ASSIGNMENT, not an argmax -- see below.
2. RECONSTRUCT (the anti-collapse anchor, ON by default). From each tile's
   embedding, predict the quantized activity of EVERY bin of that same tile.
   The input is augmented and the target is clean, so it is a denoising task.
3. FORECAST (OFF by default, lambda_forecast=0). From each tile's embedding,
   predict the QUANTIZED activity of the bin immediately AFTER that tile, per
   neuron. The target bin is always inside the discarded gap, so it never leaks.

WHY THE DEFAULT IS ORDER + RECONSTRUCT, WITH FORECAST OFF. Task 2 was added
because a pure order task gives the encoder no reason to keep absolute firing
rate, and rate is usually the dominant behavior-coding feature -- that is how
pretext training ended up BELOW a frozen random encoder. Reconstruction fixed
that decisively: on Perich C-CO0 (two seeds) order+reconstruct reached MLP R2
0.848 / 0.835 against a frozen-encoder control at 0.573 / 0.571, and the order
term itself contributed +0.057 / +0.040 on top of reconstruction alone.

Task 3 was the FIRST attempt at the same anchoring job and it is strictly worse:
adding the forecast term to the winning model cost -0.132 / -0.139 R2 on both
seeds. One predicted bin is a weak constraint, and predicting across a random
gap makes the encoder model the gap process rather than the window. It is kept
as an ablation (lambda_forecast > 0) because "predict the next bin" is the
obvious thing a reader will ask about, and the answer should be measured.

READING THE ORDER HEAD. argmax over the K-way position logits is NOT a
permutation: it can put two tiles in the same slot, and an UNTRAINED head puts
all of them in one slot because the class biases swamp the tile-dependent part
of the logits. Scoring those ties as errors moves the chance level of pair
accuracy from 50% to (1 - 1/K)/2 = 37.5% at K=4, and to 0% for the degenerate
case -- so a frozen random encoder scores 0.00% and looks catastrophically
anti-correlated when it is simply undefined. This module therefore decodes with
the best-scoring permutation (`_assign`), gives ties half credit, and reports
`argmax_tie_rate_percent` so a degenerate readout is visible.

NO IDENTITY LABELS. The tiles are handed to the order head in a RANDOM order and
the label is that permutation, never [0,1,...,K-1] (shuffle_tiles=True). With a
constant identity label the head only has to be order-dependent -- through a
non-symmetric aggregation, a positional term, anything -- and "always answer
[0,1,2,3]" becomes a free 100% that no metric in this file would catch. The
DeepSets head is permutation-equivariant by construction, but that is a property
asserted in a self-test; shuffling removes the whole failure class for the price
of one gather. Set shuffle_tiles=False only to reproduce older runs.

NO L2 NORMALIZATION BY DEFAULT. normalize=True projects the embedding onto a
hypersphere and throws away magnitude. If ridge on the raw window beats your
embedding, this is the first thing to check. Left available as an ablation only.

EPOCHS. Spans overlap by construction, so the effective sample size is far below
the span count and a large budget WILL memorize the pretext task: held-out
position CE ends up many times log(K). Do not read that as "stop training". On
Perich the best decoding R2 came from the largest budget tried (10000 epochs)
with the pretext task thoroughly overfit -- the order head memorizing says
nothing about whether the trunk learned useful features. Sweep max_epochs and
pick the peak by DECODING R2, never by pretext accuracy or pretext CE.

SHORTCUTS. Tile order is recoverable from slow drift in overall level, so the
order head can become a nonstationarity detector that does not transfer. The
order branch therefore sees per-tile normalized tiles (tile_norm) plus
independent per-tile augmentation and random gaps. The forecast branch sees the
RAW view, because it is supposed to see level. evaluate_pretext always reports
the trivial "sort by mean activity" baseline next to the model.

TRUNK. trunk_block="residual" is a valid-convolution residual stack with
receptive field exactly window_size. trunk_block="separable" is a
MobileNetV2-style inverted residual (1x1 expand, GELU, DEPTHWISE 3-tap temporal
conv, GELU, 1x1 project): each neuron gets its own temporal filter and mixing
across neurons happens only in the pointwise layers, the decomposition EEGNet
uses. It is not a shortcut fix -- a linearly available shortcut stays available
-- but it is cheap and a fair ablation. Both blocks consume exactly two bins.

CONTROLS (all from the constructor)
  max_epochs=0        -> frozen random-encoder control. Your embedding must beat
                         this or training is destroying information.
  lambda_order=0.0    -> reconstruct only (the anchor's own contribution)
  lambda_forecast>0   -> add the next-bin term back (measured harmful, see above)
  lambda_reconstruct=0 -> the pre-anchor model (reproduces the collapse)
  order_grad_scale=0  -> order head trains on a trunk it cannot influence; asks
                         "is order decodable?" with zero risk to R2
  shuffle_tiles=False -> identity labels, for reproducing older runs only
  normalize=True      -> the sphere ablation
Always report pretext accuracy AND the mean-sort baseline AND decoding R2 AND
ridge on the raw window. Pretext accuracy alone proves nothing.

ALIGNMENT. transform uses natural windows, no augmentation, no tile
normalization, no masking. pad=False aligns the window starting at j with label
j + window_size//2. pad=True edge-pads and returns one row per input bin.

Split recordings BEFORE fit: a 2D array is one continuous recording; pass a list
of trial arrays to avoid crossing trials. fit always resets weights.
